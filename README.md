# Automated Purchase Order Management System (OWSB)

A Java-based application developed as part of my coursework at Asia Pacific University (CT038-3-2-OODJ â€“ Object Oriented Development with Java).  
This project automates the purchase order management process for **Omega Wholesale Sdn Bhd (OWSB)**, a wholesaler based in Kuala Lumpur.  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
As OWSB expands, manual purchase order processing became inefficient and error-prone.  
This system was designed to streamline the workflow from **Purchase Requisition (PR)** to **Purchase Order (PO)** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** in Java.  

The project emphasizes:
- Clean class design with encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.  
- Role-based authentication and access control.  
- CRUD operations for items and suppliers.  

## Features
- **User Authentication & Role-Based Access** (Sales Managers, Purchase Managers)  
- **User Registration**  
- **Item Management** â†’ Add, update, and delete items  
- **Supplier Management** â†’ Add, update, and delete suppliers  
- **Daily Sales Data Entry**  
- **Purchase Requisition (PR) Creation** by Sales Managers  
- **View Submitted PRs**  
- **Purchase Order (PO) Generation** by Purchase Managers  
- **List & Track Status of POs**  

## Technologies Used
- **Java** (Object-Oriented Development)  
- **OOP Concepts**: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction  
- **IDE**: [Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA]  

## Project Structure
- `src/` â†’ Source code  
- `docs/` â†’ Supporting documentation (design, class diagrams, implementation details)  

## Learning Outcomes
- Applied OOP concepts in a real-world procurement system.  
- Designed and implemented role-based access and authentication.  
- Developed CRUD modules for inventory and supplier management.  
- Gained experience in modular and maintainable Java development.
